Transliterate seamlessly between ITRANS, Devanagari, Telugu, Tamil, Bengali, Kannada, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, and more.

Why Sindhu

Are you a Sanskrit student, polyglot, language teacher, or content creator working across multiple Indian scripts or transliteration schemes?

Sindhu bridges the gap between tradition and technology by making Indian language scripts accessible, interoperable, and easy to work with inside Obsidian.

Type once, convert instantly.

Whether you read rAma or राम, রাম, ਰਾਮ, રામ, ରାମ, ராம, రామ, ರಾಮ, or രാമ — Sindhu keeps your focus on content, not mechanics.

Purpose and vision

Sindhu is built with respect for India’s linguistic heritage, from Sanskrit śāstras to modern regional literature.

न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते
na hi jñānena sadṛśaṃ pavitram iha vidyate
“There is nothing as purifying as knowledge.” — Bhagavad Gita 4.38

For many learners, reading Devanagari or other Indic scripts can be challenging.
Sindhu lowers this barrier by enabling accurate transliteration into familiar scripts—without compromising phonetic precision.
