### 🧘‍♂️ Purpose & Vision 🧘‍♂️

Sindhu was built with deep respect for India's linguistic heritage and the wisdom preserved through its scripts—from Sanskrit _śāstras_ to modern regional texts.

> **"न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते"
> "na hi j~nAnena sadRRishaM pavitramiha vidyate"**  
> _"There is nothing as purifying as knowledge." – Bhagavad Gita 4.38_

For many, reading Indian languages in संस्कृत (saMskRRita) script can feel a bit daunting. **Sindhu removes this barrier**, letting users transliterate to readable, familiar scripts—**without compromising phonetic accuracy**.
